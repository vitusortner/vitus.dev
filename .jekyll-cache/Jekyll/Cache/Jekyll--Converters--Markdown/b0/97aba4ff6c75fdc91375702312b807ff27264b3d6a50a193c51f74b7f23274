I"ù<p>I‚Äôm doing front-end development with statically-typed languages and from time to time I write about it.
At the moment, I‚Äôm working as an Android developer in Berlin, Germany.</p>

<p>My current interests lie somewhere between the concepts behind declarative UI and advocating the usage of relational databases on mobile clients while embracing the differences of the relational and object-oriented paradigms.
I work on <a href="https://github.com/vitusortner">open-source projects</a> and maintain a <a href="https://github.com/vitusortner/floor">SQLite abstraction library</a> used by cross-platform applications.
I frequently get amazed by ergonomic APIs.</p>
